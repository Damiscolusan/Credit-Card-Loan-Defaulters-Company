.The Business Problem
Our client is a credit card company. They have brought us a dataset that includes
some demographics and recent financial data, over the past 6 months, for a sample
of 30,000 of their account holders. This data is at the credit account level; in other
words, there is one row for each account (you should always clarify what the
definition of a row is, in a dataset). Rows are labeled by whether, in the next month
after the 6-month historical data period, an account owner has defaulted, or in other
words, failed to make the minimum payment.

`Goal`

Your goal is to do Baisc Data Cleaning and exploration of the Dataset
